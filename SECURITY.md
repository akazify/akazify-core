# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please email: security@akazify.com
- Do not file public GitHub issues for security problems.
- Provide a clear description, affected versions, and steps to reproduce.
- If possible, include a minimal proof of concept.

## Embargo & Disclosure

- We follow coordinated disclosure with an initial 90-day embargo window.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- We will work with you to validate, remediate, and coordinate disclosure.

## Scope

- Akazify Core (OSS) components and Edge Gateway components.
- Commercial components are in scope for customers under support; disclose privately via the same channel.

## Cryptography & Signing

- Release artifacts will be signed (plan: `cosign`) and include SBOMs (CycloneDX).

## Safe Harbor

If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your
security research, we will not pursue or support legal action related to your research.
