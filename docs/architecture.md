# Factory Management System — Requirements Draft (Updated for Scalability & Configurability)

## 1. Executive Summary

A state-of-the-art Factory Management System (FMS) designed to accommodate** ****popular and standard manufacturing infrastructures** while being** ****easily configurable** for** ****small, medium, and large-scale factories**. The system uses a** ****permission-based access model** with configurable roles to adapt to factories of all sizes and organizational structures. It will provide modular deployment options, scalable architecture, and configurable workflows so factories can adopt features at their own pace.

**Primary objectives**

* Increase throughput and OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness).
* Reduce lead times, stockouts, and waste.
* Improve product quality and traceability.
* Reduce unplanned downtime through predictive maintenance.
* Ensure compliance with international standards and regulatory frameworks (ISO, FDA, OSHA, IEC).
* Provide a flexible, scalable solution that grows with the factory’s size and complexity.

## 2. Stakeholders & Access Model

Factories differ widely in roles depending on their size, industry, and maturity. To support this diversity, the FMS implements** ****permission-based access control (PBAC)**:

### 2.1 Permission-Based Access

* **Permissions** are the core unit of access (e.g.,** ***view production orders*,** ***edit BOM*,** ***approve QC check*,** ***trigger maintenance work order*).
* Users are granted permissions directly or via** ****roles**.
* Permissions cover all functional areas: MES, Inventory, Planning, Quality, Maintenance, Procurement, Reporting, and Administration.

### 2.2 Roles as Templates

* **Roles** are templates that group permissions into logical sets.
* The system ships with** ****default roles** based on common factory functions (Operator, Supervisor, Planner, QC Engineer, Maintenance Tech, Warehouse Clerk, Procurement Manager, Plant Manager, IT Admin).
* Factories can** ****customize, merge, or split roles** depending on their structure.
* Example:
  * In a** ****small factory**, one person might hold a merged role (e.g., Supervisor + Planner).
  * In a** ****large enterprise**, roles might be highly specialized (e.g., separate roles for Preventive Maintenance vs Predictive Maintenance).

### 2.3 Stakeholders

While exact roles differ, typical** ****stakeholders** include:

* **Operators**: Perform production tasks, log output, report issues.
* **Supervisors**: Oversee shifts, monitor performance, handle escalations.
* **Planners/Production Managers**: Create and manage production schedules.
* **Quality Assurance (QA/QC)**: Conduct inspections, record results, manage non-conformances.
* **Maintenance Teams**: Preventive, corrective, and predictive maintenance.
* **Warehouse/Inventory Staff**: Manage materials, WIP, finished goods.
* **Procurement & Supply Chain Managers**: Handle sourcing, suppliers, inbound logistics.
* **Plant Manager / Operations Director**: Oversee operations, KPIs, compliance.
* **IT/DevOps**: Manage integrations, infrastructure, and system security.
* **External Stakeholders**: Suppliers, logistics providers, ERP vendors, regulatory auditors.

This flexible model ensures** ****each factory can configure roles and responsibilities** to match its workforce structure without forcing rigid defaults.

## 4. Configurability Across Factory Sizes

### Small-Scale Factories

- Cloud-based SaaS deployment with minimal IT overhead.
- Simplified inventory, work orders, and dashboards.
- Pre-configured templates for workflows and KPIs.
- Mobile-first operator access.

### Medium-Scale Factories

- Hybrid deployment (cloud + on-prem edge gateways).
- Configurable MES modules (work orders, BOMs, QC sampling).
- Barcode/RFID support.
- Preventive maintenance module.
- Multi-user roles with granular permissions.

### Large-Scale Factories

- Full ISA-95 compliant MES + ERP integration.
- Advanced scheduling and optimization engines.
- AI-driven predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.
- EDI procurement, multi-plant coordination.
- High availability and disaster recovery setup.

---

## 5. Functional Requirements (Highlights)

- **Tiered functionality**: Core, Advanced, Enterprise editions.
- **Template-based configuration**: factories can select workflows and KPIs from a library (discrete, process, hybrid manufacturing).
- **Scalable integrations**: ERP/PLCs optional for SMEs, standard for large factories.
- **UI-driven configuration**: Admins can enable/disable modules without coding.

---

## 6. Non-functional Requirements (Enhanced)

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale from 1 production line to hundreds.
- **Configurability**: Plug-and-play modules, configurable without developer intervention.
- **Availability**: Cloud-hosted option for SMEs, enterprise-grade HA for large factories.
- **Performance**: Lightweight for SMEs, high-throughput ingestion for enterprises.

## 7. Roadmap (Revised)

**Phase 1 (MVP – Small Factories):** Core MES (work orders, inventory, dashboards), SaaS-based, mobile-first, quick setup.

**Phase 2 (Medium Factories):** Hybrid deployment, configurable MES (BOM, QC, maintenance), ERP connectors.

**Phase 3 (Large Factories):** Advanced AI-driven scheduling, predictive maintenance, EDI procurement, multi-plant management.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Complexity overwhelming small users** → Mitigation: Preconfigured templates and minimal-setup SaaS option.
- **Scalability bottlenecks for large factories** → Mitigation: Microservices, Kubernetes, multi-tenant scaling.
- **Integration costs** → Mitigation: tiered integration options, connectors for popular ERPs.

**9. Data Model & Key Entities**

Aligned with **ISA-95** standards and extensible.

**Core Entities:**

* **User** — has login credentials, assigned roles/permissions.
* **Role** — template grouping permissions.
* **Permission** — atomic action (view, edit, approve).
* **Machine/Equipment** — production assets, status, maintenance history.
* **Work Order** — scheduled production tasks.
* **Bill of Materials (BOM)** — list of components for a product.
* **Production Order** — execution unit combining BOM, routing, and schedule.
* **Inventory Item** — raw materials, WIP, finished goods.
* **Supplier** — external entity for procurement.
* **QC Record** — inspection/test result with traceability.
* **Maintenance Record** — logs preventive, corrective, predictive actions.
* **Shift / Schedule** — workforce allocation.
* **Audit Log** — tracks user/system activity for compliance.
